# Onboarding

Welcome to the Concentrix Developer Portal, powered by Backstage! Our portal is designed to streamline and enhance the developer experience for building applications and services that integrate with Concentrix's financial ecosystem.

As you navigate through the portal, you'll discover a rich catalog of services and resources that enable seamless integration with Concentrix's platform. Let's explore some of the key components:

1. Financial Account Identity Verification (fac-identity-verification):
   This service provides a robust set of APIs and tools for verifying the identity of users associated with financial accounts. With fac-identity-verification, you can securely authenticate users, reduce fraud, and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The service offers features like multi-factor authentication, identity document verification, and risk assessment.
2. KYC Audit Logger (kyc-audit-logger):
   The kyc-audit-logger service is essential for maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. It captures and logs all relevant events and activities related to KYC compliance, including user onboarding, identity verification, and ongoing monitoring. With this service, you can easily generate reports, conduct audits, and demonstrate compliance to regulatory authorities.
3. Financial Account Monitoring (fac-monitor):
   Concentrix's fac-monitor service enables real-time monitoring of financial accounts, providing valuable insights and alerts for various events and activities. You can track account balances, detect suspicious transactions, and receive notifications for significant changes. This service helps you proactively manage risk, prevent fraud, and deliver a secure and reliable experience to your users.
4. Financial Account Transaction Monitoring (fac-transaction-monitoring):
   The fac-transaction-monitoring service allows you to monitor and analyze financial transactions in real-time. It provides powerful tools for detecting anomalies, identifying patterns, and flagging potential fraudulent activities. With this service, you can gain deep insights into user behavior, implement risk mitigation strategies, and ensure the integrity of financial transactions.

In addition to these core services, our Backstage portal offers a range of resources to streamline your development process:

1. FDX API Banking Integration Scaffolding:
   For banks that expose APIs following the Financial Data Exchange (FDX) standard, we provide scaffolding templates and tools to accelerate the integration process. Our scaffolding generates boilerplate code, API client libraries, and documentation, enabling you to quickly connect to FDX-compliant APIs and access a wide range of financial data and functionality.
2. Legacy Banking Integration Scaffolding:
   We understand that not all banks have adopted modern APIs. For banks that rely on legacy systems, our portal offers scaffolding resources to simplify the integration process. These resources include pre-built connectors, data mapping templates, and guides to help you navigate the challenges of integrating with legacy banking systems.

With Backstage as the foundation of our developer portal, you can discover, explore, and leverage Concentrix's services and resources with ease. The portal provides a centralized hub for documentation, API references, and guides, making it simple to find the information you need.

Our portal also fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers. You can connect with the Concentrix developer community, participate in forums, and access support channels to get help and guidance when needed.

We are continuously expanding and enhancing our developer portal to meet the evolving needs of our developers. With Concentrix's Backstage-powered portal, you have the tools, resources, and support to build innovative financial applications and deliver seamless experiences to your users.

Thank you for choosing Concentrix as your trusted partner in the financial ecosystem. We look forward to seeing the incredible applications and services you will build using our platform. If you have any questions or need further assistance, our team is here to help you every step of the way.
